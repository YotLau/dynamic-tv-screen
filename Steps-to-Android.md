# Steps to Convert Dynamic TV Screen to Android App

This document outlines the step-by-step process to convert the current web-based Dynamic TV Screen project into a functional Android application. Each task is designed to be completed sequentially by an AI agent.

## Project Overview

The Dynamic TV Screen project currently consists of:
- A Python backend (Flask API)
- A React frontend
- Image generation and fetching capabilities
- TV communication functionality

The goal is to create an Android application that maintains the core functionality while adapting to the mobile platform.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

### Task 1.1: Set up Android Development Environment
- Install Android Studio
- Configure JDK and Android SDK
- Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) for testing

### Task 1.2: Create a New Android Project
- Create a new Android project with appropriate package name (e.g., com.dynamictvscreen)
- Configure minimum SDK level (recommend API level 24/Android 7.0 or higher)
- Set up initial project structure

### Task 1.3: Analyze Current Project Structure
- Review the existing codebase to identify core components
- Document API endpoints and data flow
- Identify key features that need to be ported to Android

## Phase 2: Backend Integration

### Task 2.1: Decide on Backend Approach
- Option 1: Keep existing Python backend and communicate via API
- Option 2: Port backend logic to Android (Java/Kotlin)
- Evaluate pros and cons of each approach based on project requirements

### Task 2.2: Set Up API Communication
- Implement Retrofit or similar HTTP client for API communication
- Create data models matching the current API response structure
- Implement error handling and network state management

### Task 2.3: Implement Authentication (if applicable)
- Port existing authentication mechanism to Android
- Implement secure storage for credentials
- Set up session management

## Phase 3: Core Functionality Implementation

### Task 3.1: Implement Image Fetching and Display
- Create services to fetch images from the backend or directly from sources
- Implement efficient image loading and caching (using Glide or Picasso)
- Create UI components for image display

### Task 3.2: Port TV Communication Features
- Implement TV discovery and connection functionality
- Create services for pushing content to connected TVs
- Implement necessary protocols (DLNA, Chromecast, etc.)

### Task 3.3: Implement Image Generation Features
- Port image generation logic to Android
- Implement UI for customizing image generation
- Create background services for processing if needed

## Phase 4: User Interface Development

### Task 4.1: Design Android UI
- Create wireframes for Android app screens
- Implement Material Design components
- Ensure responsive layouts for different screen sizes

### Task 4.2: Implement Main Screens
- Create home screen/dashboard
- Implement settings screen
- Develop image browsing and management screens

### Task 4.3: Implement Navigation
- Set up navigation components (drawer, bottom nav, or tabs)
- Implement screen transitions and animations
- Ensure proper back stack behavior

## Phase 5: Advanced Features and Optimization

### Task 5.1: Implement Background Processing
- Set up WorkManager for scheduled tasks
- Implement background image processing
- Configure notifications for important events

### Task 5.2: Add Offline Capabilities
- Implement local storage for images and settings
- Create synchronization mechanism for when connectivity is restored
- Handle offline gracefully in the UI

### Task 5.3: Optimize Performance
- Analyze and optimize memory usage
- Implement efficient image handling
- Optimize battery usage

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

### Task 6.1: Implement Automated Tests
- Create unit tests for core functionality
- Implement UI tests for critical user flows
- Set up integration tests for API communication

### Task 6.2: Conduct Manual Testing
- Test on multiple device types and Android versions
- Verify all features work as expected
- Perform usability testing

### Task 6.3: Prepare for Release
- Configure app signing
- Create store listing assets (screenshots, descriptions)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for builds

### Task 6.4: Deploy to Google Play
- Create Google Play developer account
- Upload app bundle to Google Play Console
- Configure release tracks (internal, alpha, beta, production)

## Phase 7: Maintenance and Updates

### Task 7.1: Monitor App Performance
- Implement crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)
- Set up analytics to track user behavior
- Monitor API usage and performance

### Task 7.2: Plan for Updates
- Create roadmap for future features
- Implement in-app update mechanism
- Plan version compatibility strategy

## Notes for AI Agent

- Prioritize maintaining feature parity with the web version
- Consider Android platform limitations and capabilities
- Focus on creating a native Android experience rather than simply porting the web UI
- Document all implementation decisions and technical debt for future reference
